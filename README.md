# Case Based Reasoning

The R package case-based-reasoning provides an R interface case-based reasoning using machine learning methods.

## Installation

#### CRAN

```
install.packages("CaseBasedReasoning")
```

#### GITHUB

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sipemu/case-based-reasoning")
```

## Features

This R package provides two methods case-based reasoning by using an endpoint:

- Linear, logistic, and CPH Regression

- Proximity and Depth Measure extracted from a fitted random forest ([ranger](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) package)

Besides the functionality of searching for similar cases, we added some additional features:

- automatic validation of the critical variables between the query and similar cases dataset

- checking proportional hazard assumption for the Cox Model

- C++-functions for distance calculation


## Example: Cox Beta Model

### Initialization

In the first example, we use theCPH model and the `ovarian` data set from the 
`survival` package. In the first step, we initialize the R6 data object. 

```
library(tidyverse)
library(survival)
library(CaseBasedReasoning)
ovarian$resid.ds <- factor(ovarian$resid.ds)
ovarian$rx <- factor(ovarian$rx)
ovarian$ecog.ps <- factor(ovarian$ecog.ps)

# initialize R6 object
coxBeta <- CoxBetaModel$new(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ age + resid.ds + rx + ecog.ps)
```

### Similar Cases 

After the initialization, we may want to get for each case in the query data the most similar case from the learning data. 

```{r}
n <- nrow(ovarian)
trainID <- sample(1:n, floor(0.8 * n), F)
testID <- (1:n)[-trainID]

# fit model 
ovarian[trainID, ] %>% 
  coxBeta$fit()
# get similar cases
ovarian[testID, ] %>%
  coxBeta$get_similar_cases(queryData = ovarian[testID, ], k = 3) -> matchedData
```

You may extract then the similar cases and the verum data and put them together:

**Note 1:** In the initialization step, we dropped all cases with missing values in the variables of ` data` and ` endPoint`. So, you need to make sure that you do missing value analysis before.

**Note 2:** The `data.table` returned from `coxBeta$get_similar_cases` has four additional columns:

1. `caseId`: By this column, you may map the similar cases to cases in data, e.g., if you had chosen ` k = 3`, then the first three elements in the column `caseId` will be ` 1` (following three ` 2` and so on). These three cases are the three most similar cases to case ` 0` in verum data.
2. `scDist`: The calculated distance
3. `scCaseId`: Grouping number of the query with matched data
4. `group`: Grouping matched or query data


### Distance Matrix

Alternatively, you may be interested in the distance matrix:

```{r}
ovarian %>%
  coxBeta$calc_distance_matrix() -> distMatrix
```
`coxBeta$calc_distance_matrix()` calculates the distance matrix between train and test data, when test data is omitted, the distances between observations in the test data is calculated. Rows are observations in train and columns observations of test.
The distance matrix is saved internally in the `CoxBetaModel` object: `coxBeta$distMat`.


## Example: RandomForest Model

### Initialization 

In the second example, we apply a RandomForest model for approximating the distance measure  on the `ovarian` data. Two possibilities for distance/similarity calculation are offered (details can be found in the documentation): 

- Proximity: When comparing two observations, the mean of having the same end node over all trees is calculated

- Depth: When comparing two observations, the mean length of edges between the two end nodes over all trees is calculated 

Let's initialize the model object: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(survival)
library(CaseBasedReasoning)
ovarian$resid.ds <- factor(ovarian$resid.ds)
ovarian$rx <- factor(ovarian$rx)
ovarian$ecog.ps <- factor(ovarian$ecog.ps)

# initialize R6 object
rfSC <- RFModel$new(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ age + resid.ds + rx + ecog.ps)
```

All observations with missing values in training and endpoint variables are dropped (`na.omit`) and the reduced data without missing values is stored internally. You get a text output on how many cases were dropped. Furthermore, `character` variables will be transformed to `factor`.

Optionally, you can adjust RandomForest parameters when initializing the model. The documentation of setable parameters can be found in the ranger R-package. 

As described, we offer two distance measures are offered:

+ `Depth` (Default)
+ `Proximity`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rfSC$set_dist(distMethod = "Proximity")
```

All following steps are the same as above:

**Similar Cases:**
```{r}
n <- nrow(ovarian)
trainID <- sample(1:n, floor(0.8 * n), F)
testID <- (1:n)[-trainID]

# train model 
ovarian[trainID, ] %>% 
  rfSC$fit()
# get similar cases
ovarian[trainID, ] %>%
  rfSC$get_similar_cases(queryData = ovarian[testID, ], k = 3) -> matchedData
```

**Distance Matrix Calculation:**
```{r}
ovarian %>%
  rfSC$calc_distance_matrix() -> distMatrix
```
